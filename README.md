# ePaint to-do list

- fix issues with file naming on release, improve windows installer

- instead of quietly setting res to 100x100, inform user of this minimum when making a new canvas
- maybe allow resizing current drawing instead of having to make a new one
- Ctrl+Scroll or Ctrl+-\+ to zoom
- remove all debug messages (when finished)
- maybe replace the default HTML color picker
